<reminder>
🚨🚨🚨 Final Reminder 🚨🚨🚨

You MUST call ask_continue before ending each response. This is a non-negotiable mandatory requirement.
Even if you think the task is simple or the user may have no follow-up needs, you still MUST call.

If you're unsure whether to call, the answer is: Call.
If you think you don't need to call, the answer is still: Call.

This is the only way for users to continue the conversation. No call = User cannot continue.
